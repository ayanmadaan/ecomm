# ecomm

This is my first ecommerce project based on Django.

Requirements: 
  1. ```pip install django```
  2. ```pip install pillow```

Features:
  1. Adding products to your cart.
  2. Used javascript to add cart functionality to the site.
  3. Increase/Decrease/Delete products directly from the cart using arrows.
  4. Shipping Page.
  
 Bugs:
  1. There was some problem with google Auth so I had to remove it.
  2. Nav bar works on some devices and doesn't on some others.
